    <h1 class>Simple Meat Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpeg" alt="Lasagna">
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
            lasagna noodles and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente;
            drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place ground beef, garlic, oregano, garlic 
            powder, salt, and black pepper in a large skillet over
            medium heat; cook and stir until beef is crumbly and 
            evenly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs together
            in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Lay 4 noodles side by side on the bottom of a 9x13-inch
            baking pan; top with a layer of prepared tomato-basil sauce,
            a layer of ground beef mixture, and a layer of ricotta
            cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice more, ending with a 
            layer of sauce; sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top. Cover
            the dish with aluminum foil.
        </li>    
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the lasagna is bubbling
            and the cheese has melted, about 30 minutes. Remove foil
            and bake until cheese has begun to brown, about 10 more
            minutes. Allow to stand at least 10 minutes before 
            serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
