    <p class="title"><strong>Ingredients - Buttercream Frosting</strong></p>
    <ul><div class="content">
        <li>1 stick salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 - 2 1/2 cups powdered surgar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy cream or milk</li>
    </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="title"><strong><em>Instructions:</em></strong></p>
    <ol><div class="content">
        <li>In a medium bowl, whip the butter. </li>
        <li>Add in 1 cup of powdered sugar. Mix until combined. </li>
        <li>Add the vanilla and additional powdered sugar, a little 
            at a time. </li>
        <li>Add 1 Tablespoon of heavy cream or milk to make the 
            frosting thick and creamy. It should hold a point.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, crumble the prepared cake into fine 
            crumbs (make sure it has cooled completely before 
            crumbling). </li>
        <li>Add 2 spoonfuls of buttercream frosting to the cake. 
            Combine with your hands or a spoon. Gradually add more 
            frosting until the cake holds together if squeezed. You 
            don't want it too crumbly or it won't hold together.</li>
        <li>Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop out 1 scoop of cake 
            mixture. Roll into a ball and place onto a plate. Repeat 
            until all the cake mixture has been formed into balls. 
            Freeze balls for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Right before they are ready to be taken out of the 
            freezer, melt the dark chocolate and the white chocolate 
            in two separate microwave safe bowls. Begin by heating 
            for 30 seconds and then stirring. Once coated in 
            chocolate, gently tap the stick on the side of the melting
             dish to let the excess drip off. You can also spin or 
             twirl the cake pop to remove the excess.</li>
        <li>Before the chocolate starts to harden, add sprinkles, 
            jimmies or other decorations. If decorating with more 
            chocolate, let the chocolate covering harden on the cake 
            pop. Then, using a spoon or fork, drizzle with the 
            additional melted chocolate.</li>
        <li>Push the cake pop stick into a styrofoam block or use a 
            glass filled with rice to hold them upright. The chocolate
             will be set in about an hour. Store for 3-4 days in an 
             airtight container in a cool place.</li>
